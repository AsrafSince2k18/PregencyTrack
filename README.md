# Pregency vitals track

This project is built using Jetpack Compose for a modern and declarative UI. It follows the
architecture to maintain a clear separation of concerns and ensure better scalability.
For state management, the project uses StateFlow, ensuring a reactive and lifecycle-aware 
approach to UI updates. Room Database is implemented for efficient local data storage and 
management, while WorkManager handles background tasks reliably.
## Additionally, the project includes:
- Run Time Permission
- Splash Screen with API Integration to load essential data at startup.
- DataStore Preferences for secure and efficient key-value data storage.
- Onboarding Screen to guide users through the initial setup.
